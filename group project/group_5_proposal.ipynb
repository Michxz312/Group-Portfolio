    "\n",
    "How can we optimize the scheduling of employees in a financial institution to minimize labor costs while ensuring customer demand is met and considering employee preferences and skill levels?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevant Real-world Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Study employee scheduling practices in banks or financial institutions.\n",
    "* Explore existing optimization algorithms applied to employee scheduling problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data and Computations:**\n",
    "\n",
    " Data:\n",
    "* Employee availability and preferences.\n",
    "* Historical customer demand patterns.\n",
    "* Employee skill levels and qualifications.\n",
    "* Labor costs for different time slots.\n",
    "\n",
    " Computations:\n",
    "* Formulate the scheduling problem as an optimization model, considering constraints such as employee availability, customer demand, and skill requirements.\n",
    "* Try to explore and implement optimization algorithms in order to find the optimal schedule.\n",
    "* Validate the model using real or simulated data."
