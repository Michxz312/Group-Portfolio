    "## Project Title: Employee Scheduling for a Financial Institution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we optimize the scheduling of employees in a financial institution to minimize labor costs while ensuring customer demand is met and considering employee preferences and skill levels?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevant Real-world Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Study employee scheduling practices in banks or financial institutions.\n",
    "* Explore existing optimization algorithms applied to employee scheduling problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data and Computations:**\n",
    "\n",
    " Data:\n",
    "* Employee availability and preferences.\n",
    "* Historical customer demand patterns.\n",
    "* Employee skill levels and qualifications.\n",
    "* Labor costs for different time slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: In search of a suitable dataset to apply this optimization on, we will attempt to find relevant employee scheduling information from local organizations like banks, investment firms and other financial institutions. There are of course some difficulties when it comes to obtaining said data:\n",
    "1. Companies might not release such data publicly\n",
    "2. Needed data might not be formatted as expected\n",
    "3. A lack of data in general on employee scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "We will attempt to remedy this through a few methods, such as reaching out to companies to obtain anonymous data, generate data based on a few known paramater distributions etc.\n",
    "\n",
    " Computations:\n",
    "* Formulate the scheduling problem as an optimization model, considering constraints such as employee availability, customer demand, and skill requirements.\n",
    "* Try to explore and implement optimization algorithms in order to find the optimal schedule.\n",
    "* Validate the model using real or simulated data."
